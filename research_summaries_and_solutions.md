## Articles and Summaries

### [How ChatGPT Reinforces Standard Dialect Ideology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08726)  
**Summary:**  
This paper explores how AI tools like ChatGPT reinforce linguistic hierarchies by prioritizing Standard American English (SAE) over non-standard varieties such as African American English (AAE) and Indian English. It highlights training data bias, performance discrepancies, and stereotyping in AI outputs.

### [Covert Racism in AI: How Language Models Reinforce Outdated Stereotypes](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/covert-racism-ai-how-language-models-are-reinforcing-outdated-stereotypes)  
**Summary:**  
This Stanford study reveals that while overt racism in Large Dialect Models (LDMs) has decreased, covert racism persists, particularly against AAE speakers. It warns of significant societal risks when LDMs are utilized in critical decision-making areas such as hiring and legal systems.

## Analysis and Insights

### Lessons Learned from Reproducing Bias Mitigation for Large Dialect Models

**Strengths:**  
- The solution employed Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and fine-tuning techniques, effectively reducing overt biases in LDMs.  
- Evaluation (e.g., Toxicity and Regard tests) showed low toxicity scores (~0.0068) across 100 prompts.  
- Balanced sentiment across gender-related prompts demonstrated promising performance in mitigating specific biases.

**Limitations:**  
- Covert biases persisted, particularly concerning AAE. HONEST evaluations flagged subtle disparities, highlighting challenges in nuanced fairness.  
- The model's performance heavily relied on dataset quality and diversity, revealing a gap in addressing systemic biases.

**Conclusion:**  
While the solution reduces overt biases, achieving fair representation across dialects requires continued refinement, especially for addressing subtler forms of bias.
